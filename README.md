# Industrial-Welding-Production-Dashboard
Every industry in this data-driven world is implementing different BI solutions to evaluate their data and enhance corporate operations and customer service standards. I created a responsive, eye-catching dashboard in Microsoft PowerBI based on the Kaggle dataset of a well-known heavy equipment manufacturing industry to provide insights into the many factors such weld-deposition, defective length, discrepancy, etc. with the various filters. Various DAX formulas were used in this dashboard to extract insightful statistics from the supplied information.
